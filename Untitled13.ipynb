    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "Ans.  A variable is basically the name of the location in the primary memory of your computer. This can be chosen by you. A variable can store everything from strings to numbers. String is an immutable sequence data type. It is the sequence of Unicode characters wrapped inside single, double, or triple quotes. \n"

    "Ans.  An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value. An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions. Expressions need to be evaluated. If you ask Python to print an expression, the interpreter evaluates the expression and displays the result.\n"
